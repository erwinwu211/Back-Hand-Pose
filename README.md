#  Back-Hand-Pose

This is a demonstration of the paper "Back-Hand-Pose: 3D Hand Pose Estimation for Wrist-wornDevices via Dorsum Deformation Analysis" which deal with estimating human hand pose from a wrist-worn camera. The deformation of the back of hand is analyzed and mapped to a special joint angle-based 3D hand representation, and the joint angle is then reconstructed to 3D Hand Pose by Unity and IK.
