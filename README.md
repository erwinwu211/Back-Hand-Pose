#  Back-Hand-Pose

This is the official repository of the paper "Back-Hand-Pose: 3D Hand Pose Estimation for Wrist-worn Camera via Dorsum Deformation Network" which deal with estimating human hand pose from a wrist-worn camera. The deformation of the back of hand is analyzed and mapped to a special joint angle-based 3D hand representation, and the joint angle is then reconstructed to 3D Hand Pose by Unity and IK.

This demonstration here provide the several contents:
1. The data preprocessing network for generating masked dorsal hand.
2. Estimating real-time joint angle from masked dorsal hand.
